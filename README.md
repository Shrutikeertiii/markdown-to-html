# Markdown to HTML Converter

This is a simple, single-page web application designed to convert Markdown files (`.md`) into rendered HTML directly in the browser. It leverages the `marked.js` library for Markdown parsing and `Tailwind CSS` for responsive styling.

## Features

*   **Markdown Rendering**: Converts `input.md` to readable HTML.
*   **Responsive Design**: Built with Tailwind CSS to look good on various screen sizes.
*   **Single File**: All necessary code (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) is contained within `index.html` for easy deployment.

## Getting Started

To use this application, simply ensure the `input.md` file is present in the same directory as `index.html`.

### Prerequisites

*   A web browser.
*   The `input.md` file you wish to render.

### Installation and Usage

1.  Place the `index.html` file and your `input.md` file in the same directory.
2.  Open `index.html` in your web browser.

The content of `input.md` will automatically be fetched, parsed, and displayed as HTML on the page.

## Technologies Used

*   **HTML5**: Structure of the web page.
*   **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for styling.
*   **Marked.js**: A fast Markdown parser and compiler.
